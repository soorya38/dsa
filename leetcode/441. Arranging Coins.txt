441. Arranging Coins

You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

            long long int mid = i + (j-i) / 2;
            long long int v = (mid * (mid+1)) / 2;
            if(v == n)
                return mid;
            else if(v > n)
                j = mid - 1;
            else
                i = mid + 1;
        }
        return i-1;
