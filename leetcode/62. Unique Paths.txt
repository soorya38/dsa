There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down

Solution :
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> nums(m, vector<int>(n));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                    nums[i][j] = 1;
                else
                    nums[i][j] = nums[i-1][j] + nums[i][j-1];
            }
        }
        return nums[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
