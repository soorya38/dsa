Hint
There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the given star graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
Example 2:

Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

3 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
The given edges represent a valid star graph.

solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        map<int, vector<int>> g;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++) {
            g[nums[i][0]].push_back(nums[i][1]);
            g[nums[i][1]].push_back(nums[i][0]);
        }
        for(auto i: g) {
            if(i.second.size() > 1)
                return i.first;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
